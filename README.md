# WndExploits

This is a repository responsible for holding all of the CVE exploits I tend to replicate in a journey to learning exploitation via static and dynamic analysis.

Each folder in the repository is named after the CVE and contains a write-up regarding how the bug works and how it was exploited, including code examples also.

Many of the CVE's used are from 10-20 years ago in order to not start in the deep end and help me understand the methods/attack vectors that are used in order to exploit these applications.
